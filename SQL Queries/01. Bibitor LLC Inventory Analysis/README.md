## ðŸ“œ SQL Analysis Scripts

This repository contains the following SQL scripts designed to achieve the analysis goals:

### 1. `Initial Analysis.sql`
This script focuses on **data validation and basic summaries**. It's crucial for understanding the raw data and identifying potential quality issues. Key functions include:
* **Checking for Zero, Missing, and Inconsistent Entries**: Identifying records with zero or null values in critical financial columns (e.g., `Dollars`, `SalesDollars`, `Price`) and discrepancies where calculated totals don't match recorded ones (e.g., `Dollars` vs. `PurchasePrice * Quantity`).
* **Calculating Percentage of Zero or Null Entries**: Providing a high-level view of data completeness.
* **Generating Basic Summaries**: Offering aggregate statistics (sum, average, min, max) and date range insights for key tables (`PurchasesDec`, `SalesDec`, `VendorInvoicesDec`) to quickly grasp data scope and characteristics.
* **Performing Cross-Table Consistency Checks**: Verifying vendor consistency between `PurchasesDec` and `SalesDec` to ensure data integrity.

### 2. `Vendor Analysis.sql`
This script dives deep into **vendor performance and relationships**. It helps in strategic decision-making related to supplier management. Its capabilities include:
* **Listing All Vendors**: Providing a comprehensive list of unique vendors from both purchase and invoice records.
* **Aggregating Vendor Activities**: Summarizing total purchase orders, quantities, dollars, invoices, and freight costs for each vendor.
* **Identifying Top Vendors by Key Metrics**: Ranking vendors based on total spending, sales generated from their products, quantity purchased, and total freight costs.
* **Analyzing Freight as a Percentage of Purchase Cost**: Highlighting vendors with potentially high shipping overheads.
* **Tracking Monthly Trends**: Summarizing purchases and sales on a monthly basis to identify seasonality and trends.
* **Calculating Gross Margin by Vendor**: Determining the profitability contribution of each vendor by comparing total purchase costs to total sales revenue.

### 3. `Inventory Analysis.sql`
This script focuses on **inventory turnover and identifying slow-moving items**. It's essential for optimizing inventory levels and reducing carrying costs. This script:
* **Creates the `InventorySaleLag` Table**: A dedicated table is generated to store calculated inventory movement data. For each unique item at each store, it records the first received date, first sold date, average purchase and sales prices, and total quantities.
* **Calculates "Days to Sell"**: Determines the duration (in days) an inventory item sits from its first receipt to its first sale.
* **Identifies Slow-Moving Inventory**: Pinpoints items that exceed a predefined threshold (e.g., 60 days) between being received and sold, providing a clear list of potential problem areas for inventory management.
