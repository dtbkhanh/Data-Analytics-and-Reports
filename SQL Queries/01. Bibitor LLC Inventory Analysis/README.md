## üìú SQL Analysis Scripts

This repository contains the following SQL scripts to support the analysis:

### 1. `Initial Analysis.sql`
This script performs **foundational data validation and basic summarization**. It identifies missing/zero values, checks for data inconsistencies, and provides high-level aggregate statistics across purchase, sales, and vendor invoice datasets.

### 2. `Vendor Analysis.sql`
This script focuses on **comprehensive vendor performance analysis**. It lists all vendors, summarizes their activities, identifies top vendors by spending, sales, quantity, and freight costs, and calculates gross margins to assess profitability.

### 3. `Inventory Turnover Analysis.sql`
This script analyzes **inventory turnover and identifies slow-moving inventory**. It calculates the "Days to Sell" for each item (time from receipt to sale) and flags items that exceed a specified sale lag threshold (e.g., over 60 days).

### 4. `Inventory MovingAvgCost.sql`
This script helps analyze inventory valuation by calculating the Moving Average Cost (MAC) of items, combining sales and purchase data with inventory balances. It supports better cost control and inventory management decisions.
